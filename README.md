# ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life created using Python3, Numpy, and PyGame. This project was made just for fun, and there may be room for potential speed and memory improvements. I just found this project interesting, so I wanted to try to implement it myself.

### Prerequisits
- Python3
- NumPy 1.16.0
- PyGame 1.9.3

### Running the Software
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Using the command line, ``` $cd ``` into the location you copied this repository
3. In the main directory, run ``` $python main.py <param_1>```<br>
	- <param_1> {0,1,2,3} : 
		- 0: Starting from randomized startup matrix
		- 1: Starting from some basic patterns in the matrix
		- 2: Starting with Paul Callahan's 5x5 infinite growth matrix
		- 3: Starting with a 2x12 infinite growth matrix<br>
  
### Built With
- Python3

### Authors
- Dylan Legebokow

### Notes
- The color of a live cell will be one of three shades of green. The shade of green is irrelevant, as the coloring is purely for aesthetics
