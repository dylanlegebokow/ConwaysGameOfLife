# ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life created using Python3, Numpy, and PyGame. Note that this project was made just for fun, and I did not try to optimize any of the code for speed or memory usage.

### Prerequisits
- Python3
- NumPy 1.16.0
- PyGame 1.9.3

### Running the Software
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Using the command line, ``` $cd ``` into the location you copied this repository
3. In the main directory, run ``` $python main.py <param_1>```<br>
	- <param_1> {0,1} : Set to 0 if you want to see Conway's Game of Life started from a randomized matrix. Set to 1 if you want to see how some basic patterns progress through generations.<br>
  
### Built With
- Python3

### Authors
- Dylan Legebokow

### Notes
- The color of a live cell will be one of three shades of green. The shade of green is irrelevant, as the coloring is purely for aesthetics
